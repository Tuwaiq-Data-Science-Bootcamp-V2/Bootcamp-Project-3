1- Bar chart show average price for every front

2- Middle of Riyadh has the least properties for sale

3- The count of properties for sale in each neighbourhood doesn't effect the square price

4-Heat map show correlation for Riyadh Vill Aqar

5-the price is efected by the space and neighbourhood

6-the heihbourhood with most offers and most expensive is النرجس neighborhood

7-From the Average price according to the age of the property chart it is clears that the old real estate prices are lower compared to the new real estate

8-Real estate prices that include a swimming pool, elevator, and basement in northern Riyadh are much higher than other areas

9-Bar chart and pie chart show Aqars prices with every location,it appears that north of Riyadh has the highest prices

10-Bar chart show rooms with prices ,it appears that the villa which has 7 rooms ,has a higher price
