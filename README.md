### Final Insights:
- Scatterplot between price and apartments: The first scatterplot shows the relationship between the number of apartments, and the price in millions for each Datapoint. This scatterplot shows that there is a downward linear relationship between price and the number of apartments. The more apartments the place has the less the price it has. This seems counterintuitive to the data as shown in the scatterplot shows this to be the case. For example, the highest price has zero apartments, and one of the lowest prices have the most apartments.

- Top and bottom 5 neighborhoods per number of rooms: These two bar charts shows the top and the bottom five neighborhoods in terms of the average number of rooms per place.
